# Converting between hyrdo circuit and electrical circuits

When learning electrical circuits it is common to make analogies to water circtuis to build understanding. This is done because most people have an intuitive understanding of how water circuits works. The two types of circuits also share many common building blocks which are analougous to one another.

The building blocks of water circuits are: 
    Presure in a water circuit is the voltage equivalent in electrical circuits.
    In water circuits the flow is analogous to the current in electrical circuits.
    The reservouir, which can be viewed as the ground plane.
    The pump, which is equivalent to a source.
    The pipes, which are equivalent to PCB lanes at shorter distances and resistors at large distances.
    Presurised tanks, which can be viewed as capacitors.
    A water tank with a heavy paddle wheel inside can be viewed as an electrical inductor, as the momentum of the paddle wheel will take time to change.
    Appliences which can be viewed as externally controlled current drains.
    One way valves behave in a similar way to electrical diodes
    Valves can be seen as open/close switches

The water circuit can be wired in series or in parallel, and will exibit behaviour similar to electrical circuits in those configurations - e.g. the voltage (presure) will be the same across all the parallel lanes, but the current (flow) may be different.


Because the two types of circuits are so similar, the math required to do circuit calculations are also similar. KVL and KCL as known from electronics can also be used for water circuits. Ohms law, which describes the relationship between resistance, current and voltage in circuits has an equivalent for water circuits called XXXX.
