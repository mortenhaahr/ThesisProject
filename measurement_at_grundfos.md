Before 18.09: Intro days
- Had a couple of days getting everything set up

18.09: You think you do but you don't
- We made some measurements that we expected were good

20.09: Blissful ignorance
- We realized we were not very structured and made some more structured measurements

21.09: We discover our pain
- We see something odd with one of our measurements and show it to Jorge.
  - He says something is wrong with the setup, probably with the hydrophore.
    - We struggle with fixing the hydrophore.
  - All our previous measurements are therefore flawed.
- He says a couple of days later that he fixed the lab setup and it is working now

25.10: The day of the damned
- We come back after being gone for a while
- There are fatal flaws with the setup. At times the pump is not working entirely
- We spend the day trying to fix it. At the end we get a hold of the lab owner, who says we need to change the pump
- On 01.11 we are told that the pump was replaced

02.11: Return of the Mikkel
- Mikkel goes back to Grundfos to make new measurements
- The pump is having similar tendencies to 25.10 measurements but not as bad.

14.11: Final Destination
- We are told that it is an error with the newest version of SCALA2 pump.
- Cannot be fixed within our project duration
- We agree that we will try to use it in the current state

16.11: Epic fail
- We arrive at Grundfos and the pump is leaking water everywhere.
- The setup is not operatable at all. We need a new pump which will take a couple of days.
- Ended up going home without measuring anything...
